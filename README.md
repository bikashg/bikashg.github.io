## Education
### PhD in Computer Science (Specialisation: Natural Language Processing), 2016, Université de Lorraine, France

* Thesis on automatic generation of human friendly descriptions of RDF Triples in Knowledge Bases. [https://hal.inria.fr/tel-01276008/document](https://hal.inria.fr/tel-01276008/document)



## Work Experience
### Data Scientist, Spencer Group, UK (2022 to Present)

## Projects
### Document Classification
* Developed a bespoke machine learning solution for document categorisation at Spencer Group.
* 400+ users benefit from its usage on a daily basis for automatic registration of incoming documents/emails to project folders.


### [ON-MERRIT](https://on-merrit.eu/): Observing and Negating Matthew Effects in Responsible Re- search & Innovation Transition (Funder: European Commission).
* I worked on WP3 of this project focusing on big data analysis of scholarly publications to quantify the impact of “Open Science” practices in academia including citation practices and promotion policies. [https://github.com/on-merrit/ON-MERRIT](https://github.com/on-merrit/ON-MERRIT)


### [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/): The world’s largest collection of open access research papers (Fun- der: Jisc, UK).
* Deduplication : I developed a text mining solution which identifies near duplicate copies of documents. I deployed this as an openly accessible API running in a collection of more than 170 million scientific publications. [https://core.ac.uk/docs/#!/articles/nearDuplicateArticles](https://core.ac.uk/docs/#!/articles/nearDuplicateArticles)

* CORE-MAG Mapping Dataset: I enhanced 8.9 Million records in CORE with information from Microsoft Academic Graph which was used to provide full text pdfs of research articles. [https://core.ac.uk/documentation/dataset/](https://core.ac.uk/documentation/dataset/)

### [ModelWriter](https://itea4.org/project/modelwriter.html): Integrated authoring environment for text and KB, (Funder: European Commission).
* I developed the ‘Semantic Parser’ module of the project. I produced project deliver- ables and represented our team in international meetings, reviews and demos [https://github.com/ModelWriter/Deliverables](https://github.com/ModelWriter/Deliverables)
